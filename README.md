# dualR Dual Cycling Power Analysis in R

This repository supports a shiny app that accepts two overlapping .fit files and generates a "critical power" comparison and plots of the data.

## Vision

The vision for this work was originally curiosity and a need to generate dual power analyses with data that are not natively 1hz recording rate. The work has evolved and may be used/reused for a variety of applications in the future.
